# VGHNet
Yelp Image-to-Rating Neural Network (VGHNet) - This was a collaboration between me (V. Tran), H. Sahak, and G. Lau

VGHNet is a novel architecture that predicts five-star-scale ratings of a restaurant from images. The network is comprised of a two-part pipeline. Images are fed through a sentiment analysis network to produce a semantic/sentiment vector. This sentiment vector is then fed through a fully-connected feedforward network to produce a final rating. 
VGHNet correctly predicted 76% of ratings within a half-star margin of error. See the final report for specifics.

**NOTE**: This repo contains *functional code with missing folder dependencies*. A full declaration of our network, debugging, prototyping, and final results are documented in the attached Jupyter notebooks. Our dataset was much too large to upload, so this code will not run as-is. If you would like to view the entire project folder, please see the attached Google Colab link:
