# VGHNet
Yelp Image-to-Rating Neural Network (VGHNet) - This was a collaboration between me (V. Tran), H. Sahak, and G. Lau

VGHNet is a novel architecture that predicts five-star-scale ratings of a restaurant from images. The network is comprised of a two-part pipeline. Images are fed through a sentiment analysis network to produce a semantic/sentiment vector. This sentiment vector is then fed through a fully-connected feedforward network to produce a final rating. 
VGHNet correctly predicted 76% of ratings within a half-star margin of error. See the final report for specifics.
